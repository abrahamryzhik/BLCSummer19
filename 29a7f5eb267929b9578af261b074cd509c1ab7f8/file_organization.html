		<h1><font color="#DADADA">File Organization</font></h1>
	  <h2>Background</h2>
	  <p>Although it is hard to talk about file organization with any type of concrete example, it is nevertheless an extremely important topic, which will be discussed here.</p>
	  <h2>The Philosophy behind File Organization</h2>
	  <p>Before discussing file organization, it is important to understand what we mean by the term in this specific context. In this tutorial, file organization will refer to the way in which one keeps a spreadsheet of data organized for use. This bears incredible importance when doing work with big data, as files that are poorly organized from the beginning are incredibly difficult to work with further down the line. If one intends on working with a dataset for an extended period of time, it is important that the dataset be organized in a way that is usable in all foreseeable contexts and that it is complete.</p>
	  <p>When first creating a dataset, it is important to consider every probable use of the dataset. This is especially important in the context of datasets which take a long time to compile. For example, if one is creating a dataset with webscraping, it is best to scrape all data one would want in an organized fashion. If one scrapes only the things one will need in the near future, knowing that more will be needed down the line but thinking that that is a problem that can be solved later, then one will be heaping on more work for oneself. Webscraping can be a tedious and time consuming process, and one is well advised to go through the whole process as seldom as possible, that is to say once. It is therefore recommended that one plan ahead when creating a dataset and always err on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion. In most contexts, there is no reason that a dataset cannot handle an additional column.</p>
	  <p>The second thing to keep in mind is that datasets should be complete. That is to say that one should attempt, as often as possible, to have all the info one will need in one place. Although it may feel less organized to have a lot of columns, it is even worse to try to match data between datasets in code that is written later. That being said, if there is an organizational and logical reason to keep two different datasets, one should do this.</p>
	  <p>The idea of having a complete dataset extends furhter, however. In our other tutorials we discuss datasets of violations and their associated demographics. However, the EPA does not always give demographics information from each facility. We still, however, include the facilities lacking such information in our datasets, in case information about the facilities is to be used later on in a context in which demographics information becomes moot. Thus, the idea of completeness extends to this area as well -- the completeness of data points. Keep in mind that when using the data, it is relatively simple in your code to extract certain types of datapoints - facilities with no demographics information are easily skipped.</p>
	  <p>The last thing to be mentioned about file organization is that one should always create a read_me.txt file for each dataset with at least the number of each column, its header, and what it contains in it (including the format of the column). The format is especially important because some data when pulled from the web doesn't come in nice numbers. Sometimes numbers can be formatted like: "1,000,00" for example, or percentages will be written with the percentage sign, such as "10%", and ratios will may be written with rates. For the sake of ease later on, one should create note all such peculiarities so that the data is easier to use later. Remember that some datasets can be too large to open in excel on a regular laptop though a laptop may still be capable of using the data in python or R. Thus, a read me file is essential to ensure that other users do not need to go through the onerous task of figuring out formatting and positioning of the columns. An example of a few lines of such a read me file is now shown below for reference.</p>
